title: "Setup Guide: Python, uv, and VS Code"
---

## Overview

This guide walks you through **everything required to get set up**, end to end:

- Installing **Python**
- Installing **uv**
- Installing and configuring **VS Code**
- Creating a **project-based Python environment**
- Running code successfully

This is a **one-time setup**. Once completed, you will reuse this workflow all semester.

::: {.callout-note}
**Read this once, then follow it top-to-bottom.**  
Most setup problems happen when steps are skipped or done out of order.
:::

### Prerequisite
This guide assumes you know how to:  
- open Terminal (Mac) or PowerShell (Windows)  
- run a command  
- copy/paste commands  
- recognize when a command succeeds or fails  

If not, complete the short Terminal Basics video and guide before continuing. 

### What you will have when you’re done

By the end of this guide, you should have a project folder that looks like this:

```text
CLASS_FOLDER/
├── pyproject.toml
├── .venv/
└── hello.py
```

And you should be able to:
- open this folder in VS Code
- run Python code using the project environment
- install packages in a repeatable way

::: {.callout-tip}
If your folder does **not** look like this at the end, stop and fix it before moving on.
:::

## Phase 1 — Install Required Tools

### 1. Install Python (3.xx)

This text works with **Python 3.12 or higher**.  
Examples below use **Python 3.13**.

::: {.callout-important}
If you already have Python installed, you still need to **verify** the version and that it runs from the terminal.
:::

#### macOS

1. Download Python from https://www.python.org  
2. Run the installer (accept defaults)  
3. Verify in Terminal:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

#### Windows

1. Download Python from https://www.python.org  
2. **Check “Add Python to PATH” during install**  
3. Verify in PowerShell:

```powershell
python --version
pip --version
```

::: {.callout-warning}
If `python` or `pip` is “not recognized,” restart your terminal first.  
If it still fails, Python was not added to PATH.
:::

---

### 2. Install uv

`uv` manages your project, environment, and packages.

::: {.callout-note}
Do **not** install `uv` using plain `pip install uv`.  
Modern systems intentionally block this to protect your Python installation.
:::

#### macOS

##### Option A — Homebrew (if you already use it)

```bash
brew install uv
uv --version
```

##### Option B — pipx (no Homebrew required)

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Restart your terminal, then:

```bash
pipx install uv
uv --version
```

---

#### Windows

##### Option A — winget

```powershell
winget install uv
uv --version
```

##### Option B — pipx

```powershell
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install uv
uv --version
```

::: {.callout-tip}
If `uv` is “not found,” close and reopen your terminal.  
This fixes most PATH-related issues.
:::

---

### 3. Install VS Code

1. Download from https://code.visualstudio.com  
2. Install using defaults  
   - On Windows, check **Add to PATH**
3. Open VS Code

#### Install the Python extension

- Extensions → search **Python**
- Install **Python (by Microsoft)**

::: {.callout-important}
VS Code will not work correctly for Python until the **Python extension** is installed.
:::

---

## Phase 2 — Create Your Project

### 4. Create a project folder

Choose a location (Documents recommended).

#### macOS



```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/CLASS_FOLDER
cd ~/Documents/CLASS_FOLDER
```

#### Windows

```powershell
mkdir $HOME\Documents\CLASS_FOLDER
cd $HOME\Documents\CLASS_FOLDER
```

::: {.callout-note}
Avoid spaces in folder names.  
Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only.
:::

---

### 5. Initialize the project

```bash
uv init
uv venv
```

You should now see:
- `pyproject.toml`
- `.venv/`

::: {.callout-warning}
If you do **not** see `.venv`, you are not in the correct folder.
:::

---

### 6. Add a test package

```bash
uv add rich
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Using `uv add` both installs the package **and** records it in `pyproject.toml`.
:::

---

### 7. Create a test file

Create `hello.py`:

```python
from rich import print
print("[bold green]Hello from Python + uv + VS Code![/bold green]")
```

---

## Phase 3 — Connect VS Code to the Project

### 8. Open the folder in VS Code

- File → **Open Folder…**
- Select `CLASS_FOLDER`

::: {.callout-important}
Open the **folder**, not just the Python file.  
VS Code needs the folder to find `.venv`.
:::

---

### 9. Select the Python interpreter

1. Command Palette  
   - macOS: `Cmd + Shift + P`  
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
2. Choose **Python: Select Interpreter**
3. Select the interpreter inside `.venv`

::: {.callout-warning}
The **wrong interpreter** is the #1 cause of “ModuleNotFoundError.”
:::

---

## Phase 4 — Run Code (Choose One Style)

You only need **one** of the following approaches.  
Pick one and use it consistently.

---

### Option A — Activation style (recommended for beginners)

#### macOS

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python hello.py
```

#### Windows

```powershell
. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python hello.py
```

If PowerShell blocks activation:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

::: {.callout-note}
This setting applies only to **your user account**  
and is commonly required for Python environments.
:::

---

### Option B — No activation (uv-managed)

```bash
uv run python hello.py
```

::: {.callout-tip}
This avoids activation entirely and is often easier on Windows.
:::

---

## Troubleshooting

#### “ModuleNotFoundError”

::: {.callout-warning}
This almost always means Python is running **outside** the project environment.
:::

Checklist:
- VS Code interpreter is set to `.venv`
- You are in the project folder
- You activated `.venv` **or** used `uv run`

---

#### “uv: command not found”

- Restart your terminal
- Re-run `pipx ensurepath` (pipx installs)

---

### Final checkpoint

::: {.callout-important}
Do **not** move on until all of the following work.
:::

- `python --version`
- `uv --version`
- `hello.py` runs successfully
- VS Code shows the `.venv` interpreter
