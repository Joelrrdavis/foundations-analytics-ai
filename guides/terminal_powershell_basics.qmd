title: "Terminal & PowerShell Basics for This Text"
---

## Why this guide exists

Many people have **never used the terminal (Mac)** or **PowerShell (Windows)** before.  
That is completely normal.

This short guide teaches **only what you need** to successfully complete the setup and run Python code later. It is not a complete rundown of this interface. 

You do **not** need to memorize commands or understand how your computer works internally.  
You just need to be comfortable running a small number of commands and recognizing when something worked.

---

## What the terminal / PowerShell is (plain language)

Think of the terminal as:

> A text-based way to tell your computer exactly what to do, step by step.

Instead of clicking buttons, you:  
- type a command  
- press **Enter**  
- read the result  

The terminal:  
- works inside a **folder**  
- runs commands **in order**  
- shows errors immediately when something goes wrong  

---

## What this guide assumes (and teaches)

By the end of this guide, you should be able to:  

- open Terminal (Mac) or PowerShell (Windows)  
- type or paste a command  
- run a command  
- know whether it worked  
- know which folder you are in  
- move into a different folder  

---

## Part A — Opening the terminal

### macOS: Open Terminal  

You have two common options:  

#### Option 1: Spotlight (recommended)  

1. Press `Command + Space`  
2. Type **Terminal**  
3. Press Enter  

#### Option 2: Applications folder  

- Applications → Utilities → Terminal  

---

### Windows: Open PowerShell  

#### Option 1: Start Menu (recommended)  

1. Click Start  
2. Type **PowerShell**  
3. Open **Windows PowerShell** or **Windows Terminal**  

#### Option 2: Right-click menu (sometimes available)  

- Right-click in a folder  
- Choose **Open in Terminal** or **Open PowerShell here**  


---

## Part B — What you see when it opens

When the terminal opens, you will see:  
- a block of text  
- a blinking cursor  

Example (Mac):

```text
username@computer-name ~ %
```

Example (Windows):

```text
PS C:\Users\username>
```

This line is called the **prompt**.    
It tells you:  
- who you are  
- which computer you are on  
- **which folder you are currently in**  

---

### The most important rule

::: {.callout-important}
**Commands run in the current folder.**  
If you are in the wrong folder, commands will fail or create files in the wrong place.
:::

---

## Part C — Running commands

### How to run a command

1. Click in the terminal window
2. Type (or paste) a command
3. Press **Enter**

Example:

```bash
python --version
```

The computer will respond immediately.

---

### Copying and pasting commands

- **Mac:** `Cmd + C` (copy), `Cmd + V` (paste)
- **Windows:** `Ctrl + C` (copy), `Ctrl + V` (paste)

::: {.callout-tip}
It is perfectly fine to **copy and paste commands**, it is not the way *everyone* learns, but it can be a great way to just get started. But becomew an expert like this. Just a solid user.

### How to tell if a command worked

A command usually **worked** if:  
- no error message appears  
- you see output (text) that looks reasonable  
- the prompt returns and waits for the next command  

Example of success:

```text
Python 3.13.1
```

---

### How to tell if a command failed

A command likely **failed** if:
- you see words like `error`, `not found`, or `command not recognized`  
- the output looks red or alarming  
- nothing happened and the prompt did not return  

Example of failure:

```text
python : The term 'python' is not recognized
```

When this happens:  
- stop  
- read the message  
- do **not** keep running commands blindly  

---

## Part D — Where am I? (folders)

### Check your current folder

#### Mac

```bash
pwd
```

#### Windows

```powershell
cd
```

This prints the folder you are currently in.

---

### List files in the current folder

#### Mac

```bash
ls
```

#### Windows

```powershell
dir
```

You should recognize file names you expect to see.

---

## Part E — Moving between folders

### Change folders (`cd`)

`cd` means **change directory**.

#### Example (Mac)

```bash
cd Documents
```

#### Example (Windows)

```powershell
cd Documents
```

---

### Move into a specific folder

```bash
cd CLASS_FOLDER
```

(Replace `CLASS_FOLDER` with the actual folder name.)

---

### Move up one level

```bash
cd ..
```

This is useful if you accidentally went into the wrong folder.

---

::: {.callout-warning}
Folder names **must match exactly**, including capitalization.  
If a folder name has spaces, it is harder to use in the terminal.
:::

---

## Part F — Stopping a command

If a command appears to be stuck or running too long:

- Press **Ctrl + C**  

This safely stops the command.

---

## Part G — Common beginner mistakes (and fixes)

### “Nothing happened”

- Did you press **Enter**?  
- Is the cursor still blinking?  

---

### “Command not found”

- You may have typed the command incorrectly  
- You may not have the software installed yet  
- Check spelling carefully  

---

### “Permission denied” (Mac/Linux)

- This usually means you are trying to modify a protected folder  
- Move your project into **Documents** or your **home folder**  

---

### I’m nervous I’ll break something

::: {.callout-important}
You are **very unlikely** to damage your computer by running commands in this guide.
:::

We do not:  
- delete system files  
- modify protected locations  
- require administrator access  

---

### Final confidence check

Before moving on to the setup guide, make sure you can:

- open Terminal or PowerShell
- run a command
- see output
- move into a folder
- stop a command with `Ctrl + C`

If you can do those things, you are ready.
