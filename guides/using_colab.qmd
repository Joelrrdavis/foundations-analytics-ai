title: "Using Google Colab - Rapid Intro"
---

## Overview

Google Colab is a free, cloud-based environment for running Python notebooks.  
You can use it from any computer without installing Python locally. It is especially helpful if:

- Your computer cannot install packages reliably  
- You are troubleshooting your Python installation  
- You want quick access to a working Python environment  

This guide explains how to open Colab, upload or access notebooks, install packages, work with files, and download your work.

## 1. What Is Google Colab?

Google Colab provides:

- A hosted Python runtime (no setup required)  
- Built-in Jupyter-like notebook interface  
- Free GPU/TPU access  
- Integration with Google Drive  

Colab notebooks use the `.ipynb` format, but you can also copy/paste Python code from `.py` files.

## 2. Opening Google Colab

Go to:

<https://colab.research.google.com/>

You will see a window prompting you to:

- Start a new notebook  
- Upload a `.ipynb` file  
- Open from Google Drive  
- Open from GitHub  

---

## 3. Option A — Create a New Notebook

1. Go to **File → New Notebook**.  
2. A new notebook will open with a default Python environment.  
3. You can copy/paste code from the textbook or `.py` files.  

Use **Shift + Enter** to run a cell.

## 4. Option B — Upload a Notebook from Your Computer

1. Go to **File → Upload Notebook**  
2. Select the notebook you downloaded  
3. Colab will open it in a new tab  

---

## 5. Option C — Open a Notebook Directly from GitHub

1. Go to **File → Open Notebook**  
2. Choose the **GitHub** tab  
3. Paste the repository URL  
4. Select the notebook you want to open  

Example:

```
https://github.com/<your-username>/undergrad-ai-text
```

## 6. Installing Packages in Colab

Colab comes with many Python packages preinstalled.

To install additional packages:

```python
!pip install seaborn
```

Or install from a requirements file:

```python
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 7. Working with Files

### Temporary Upload

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```

### Mount Google Drive

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

Your Drive will appear at:

```
/content/drive/MyDrive/
```

## 8. Saving Your Work

#### Save to Drive  
**File → Save a copy in Drive**

#### Download  
**File → Download → .ipynb**  
**File → Download → .py**

## 9. Limitations of Colab

- Sessions time out  
- Temporary files are deleted  
- Packages must be reinstalled each session  
- Internet connection required
